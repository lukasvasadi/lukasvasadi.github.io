                        At one point, we came across a young couple standing in front of the palace, looking as if they were posing for a photo. 
                        We looked for someone holding a camera, but could find no one, and then realized that this couple was just standing there 
                        soaking in the moment, holding each other in a light embrace. <a href="posts/post-07.html">Read more...</a>

                        In a few days I will turn 24 and, with the simultaneous start of a new year, this provides a good opportunity for self-reflection. 
                        This year was pivotal in that I made several changes in my perspective toward the future, and I learned that the best way to live 
                        is to find balance and harmony among the things we value most. <a href="posts/post-06.html">Read more...</a>

                        As most of my friends know, I have a long bucket list, a very long bucket list. Fortunately, I have crossed off several items this year, 
                        one of which being to live in a foreign country.  <a href="posts/post-06.html">Read more...</a>

                        At this point, the reader may be inclined to think that the journey was over, assuming, reasonably, that the worst 
                        was behind me and now all that remained was the descent. This could not have been further from the truth. While Mount 
                        Katahdin is famous for being the northern terminus of the AT, it may be better known for the ominous trail along its 
                        narrow ridge line, appropriately called the Knife's Edge.  <a href="posts/post-05.html">Read more...</a>

                        One day I was reading a Nat Geo article that listed the best places in the world to visit during each season. 
                        The first place listed under 'Autumn Excursions' was Acadia National Park, accompanied by a beautiful picture 
                        of a night sky filled with stars. It just so happened that their annual Night Sky Festival was set for the end 
                        of September. It was decided. <a href="posts/post-04.html">Read more...</a>
