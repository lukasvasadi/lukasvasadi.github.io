                <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The PowerShell command line interface was originally intended to port Unix tools to Windows.
                    However, the developers realized that the fundamental architectural differences between Unix (and
                    Unix clones such as Linux) and Windows&#8212;namely, that Windows is an API-based operating system
                    whereas Unix manages its entire framework through text files&#8212;were insurmountable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, the developers created an entirely new command line interface and scripting language
                    that would become the basis of future Windows releases. In 2016, the project was made opensource and
                    Microsoft announced officially-supported versions for MacOS and select Linux distributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PowerShell is case insensitive and operates with cmdlets that follow a verb-noun syntax. Similar to
                    batch files, cmdlets can be used within scripts, which may be packaged into modules, to automate
                    more complicated administrative tasks.

                    Sometimes it may be useful to write shell comments, e.g., during webinars or broadcasts. Similar to
                    Unix, comments in PowerShell are preceded with <span class="code-snippet">#</span>, however, block
                    comments may be written between the <span class="code-snippet">&lt;#</span> and <span
                        class="code-snippet">#&gt;</span> symbols.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>this is a comment</span></p>
                    <p class="comment-block">
                        <span>
                            &lt;# this is a block comment where you can include more detailed information that may span
                            multiple lines #&gt;
                        </span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To measure the time required to execute a command:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Measure-Command</span> {<span
                            class="cmdlet">Get-Process</span>}</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="help">Help</h2>
                <p>
                    The developers of PowerShell believed that no user should memorize commands or syntax. As a result,
                    they packaged PowerShell with an updatable, structured help utility that provides the latest
                    information for cmdlets. With an internet connection, update help with the cmdlets below:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Update-Help</span></p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>often recommended to force execution</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Update-Help</span> -Force</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To get help on a cmdlet, use the <span class="code-snippet">Get-Help</span> utility followed by the
                    cmdlet under investigation. This will output a shortlist of helpful information and automatically
                    scroll to the bottom.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Help</span> cmdlet</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, the <span class="code-snippet">help</span> and <span class="code-snippet">man</span>
                    commands may be used to display similar, but often more extensive, detailed information, but
                    starting from the top with the option to show more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span class="code-snippet">Get-Help</span> utility may also be used to discover cmdlets for
                    particular operations. For example, when trying to find cmdlets that interactive with services,
                    i.e., background processes analogous to daemons, users can execute one of the help utilities along
                    with a combination of keywords and wildcards:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>use the wildcard * symbol to broaden search</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Help</span> *service*</p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>add a g before the search criteria to produce a shortlist of results</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Help</span> g*service*</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This will return a list of potentially relevant cmdlets with "service" as part of their name. To see
                    more extensive information about a cmdlet, use the <span class="code-snippet">-Detailed</span>
                    parameter.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>retrieve brief information about a cmdlet</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Help</span> Get-Service</p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to other shell scripting tools, the PowerShell pipe (<span class="snippet">|</span>) utility
                    allows users to pass data output from one command to the input of another.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>export a list of current active services to a csv file</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Service</span> | <span class="cmdlet">Export-csv</span>
                        -Path C:\Users\user\Desktop</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Besides executing commands on collections of objects crossing the pipeline, users can also evaluate
                    individual objects with filters. These individual objects, or items, crossing the pipeline can be
                    accessed with the <span class="snippet">$PSItem</span> variable:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>filter individual process objects where the status is running</span></p>
                    <p class="command">
                        <span class="cmdlet">Get-Service</span> | <span class="cmdlet">Where-Object</span>
                        {$PSItem.Status -eq "Running"}
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Of course, not all cmdlets will accept the objects being ferried across the pipeline. A good rule of
                    thumb&mdash;though not always the case&mdash;is that cmdlets with the same noun, e.g., <span
                        class="snippet">Get-Service</span>, <span class="snippet">Stop-Service</span>, will be
                    compatible. Specifically,
                    this means that the data leaving one cmdlet has the same property value, i.e., class type, as the
                    input required by the adjacent cmdlet in the pipeline.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Unix-like systems, where all shell interactions are based on text-based input/output,
                    PowerShell was designed to work directly with objects. In many cases, this reduces the amount of
                    work necessary to accomplish certain tasks, as there is no overhead management of filler text
                    output. As an example, if you wanted to restrict <span class="snippet">Get-Process</span> output to
                    handles greater than 900:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Process</span> | <span class="cmdlet">Where</span>
                        Handles -gt 900</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This one line of code replaces several lines that would be needed to achieve the same result with
                    Bash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every object has associated properties and methods, which describe features of the object class as
                    well as actionable functions, respectively. The <span class="snippet">Get-Member</span> utility,
                    with shorthand <span class="snippet">gm</span>, prints all properties and methods of an object along
                    with its class definition.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>find the properties of the bits service object</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-Service</span> -Name bits | <span

                </div>
                <p>
                    With this information, you can choose to customize output based on object class properties.

                <p>
                    PowerShell variables are similar to Bash variables, except that these can hold object values. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="var">$bits</span> = <span class="cmdlet">Get-Service</span> bits</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The variable <span class="snippet var">bits</span> now holds the <span class="snippet">bits</span>
                    service object. As such, this variable is subject to the object properties and methods:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>print the status of the bits service</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="var">$bits</span>.status</p>
                    <p>Running</p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>stop the bits service</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="var">$bits</span>.stop()</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that the properties of this variable are static, meaning they represent a
                    snapshot of the object at the time of variable creation. After running a method, the object must be
                    manually refreshed to update any properties that may have changed state.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>check the variable status</span></p>

                <p>
                    Remote access has to be enabled on all machines. Starting with Windows Server 2012, which is a cloud
                    operating system, remote access is enabled by default.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Enable-PSRemoting</span></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To establish a one-to-one connection:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Enter-PSSession</span> -ComputerName &lt;computer-name&gt;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Outside of a remote session, individual commands can be executed on remote machines with the <span
                        class="snippet">Invoke-Command</span> cmdlet:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>print out the system event log from a remote machine named
                            "image-processing"</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Invoke-Command</span> -ComputerName image-processing {<span
                            class="cmdlet">Get-EventLog</span> -LogName system}</p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>beware of what will be executed</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Invoke-Command</span> -ComputerName comp1,comp2,comp3 {<span
                            class="cmdlet">Restart-Computer</span>}</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Note that every PowerShell command entered into the console uses <span
                        class="snippet">Invoke-Command</span> behind the scences, with the local computer accepted as
                    the default machine. All data returned from the remote system(s) are deserialized object
                    representations, meaning that the objects contain all relevant information for the administrator,
                    but have no methods other than <span class="snippet">ToString</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If not connected to the local network, PowerShell remoting may be facilitated in a browser over
                    https web access. To set up this feature, first install <span
                        class="snippet">WindowsPowerShellWebAccess</span> on the remote machine and then configure
                    user/group privileges.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>connect to the desired machine</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Enter-PSSession</span> -ComputerName &lt;computer-name&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>install the web access feature</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Install-WindowsFeature</span> WindowsPowerShellWebAccess</p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>configure a web application for remote PowerShell access</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Install-PswaWebApplication</span> -UseTestCertificate</p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>add authorization rules for users and groups</span></p>
                    <p class="command">
                        <span class="cmdlet">Add-PswaAuthorizationRule</span>
                        -ComputerGroupName &lt;computer-group&gt; -UserName &lt;users&gt; -ConfigurationName
                        &lt;access-rights&gt;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After completing these steps, the administrator can open a browser and navigate to the web
                    address&mdash;the default being https://pwa/pwsa)&mdash;and access a PowerShell instance connected
                    to the remote machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individual commands can be executed on a remote machine without starting a PowerShell session:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Invoke-Command</span> -ComputerName &lt;computer-name&gt;
                        {<span class="var">$proc</span> = <span class="cmdlet">Get-Process</span>}</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In this case, PowerShell is loaded and initialized on the remote machine, the command is executed,
                    and then the console instance and connection are destroyed. Naturally, this means that any variables
                    are deleted from memory and thus cannot be accessed with a subsequent <span
                        class="snippet">Invoke-Command</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as hinted above, persistent PowerShell sessions can be created and accessed at various
                    points of time:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="var">$sess</span> = <span class="cmdlet">New-PSSession</span>
                        -ComputerName &lt;computer-name&gt;</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This creates a persistent remote session and stores the object inside the variable <span
                        class="snippet var">sess</span>. This session can now be used instead of <span
                        class="snippet">ComputerName</span> to pass commands to the remote machine. So long as the
                    session remains open, variables will persist in system memory and can be accessed with subsequent
                    commands.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Invoke-Command</span> -Session <span
                            class="var">$sess</span> {<span class="var">$x</span>=2}</p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Invoke-Command</span> -Session <span
                            class="var">$sess</span> {<span class="var">$x</span>}</p>
                    <p>2</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Sessions also offer the ability to share modules without installation on the local machine. For
                    example, if a server computer had the <span class="snippet">ActiveDirectory</span> module installed:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="var">$sess</span> = <span class="cmdlet">New-PSSession</span>
                        -ComputerName server</p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Import-PSSession</span> -Session <span
                            class="var">$sess</span> -Module ActiveDirectory</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now all cmdlets from <span class="snippet">ActiveDirectory</span> are available locally while the
                    session is active. Behind the scenes, the local machine builds data structures using <span
                        class="snippet">Get-Command</span> and, when these cmdlets are invoked, the relevant
                    information, e.g., input parameters, is collected and passed to the remote computer for execution.
                    This entire workflow is referred to as "implicit remoting."

                <h2 id="execution-policy">Execution Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    PowerShell has safety features that prevent users from accidentally running scripts that may
                    contain harmful or malicious code. Script execution permissions are controlled via the execution
                    policy, which can be set to <span class="snippet">Restricted</span> (default), <span
                        class="snippet">Unrestricted</span>, <span class="snippet">AllSigned</span>, <span
                        class="snippet">RemoteSigned</span>, <span class="snippet">Bypass</span>, and <span
                        class="snippet">Undefined</span>. <span class="snippet">AllSigned</span> requires that all
                    scripts downloaded or created locally have digital signatures, whereas <span
                        class="snippet">RemoteSigned</span> only requires signatures for scripts downloaded from the
                    web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is recommended to avoid <span class="snippet">Unrestricted</span> and <span
                        class="snippet">Bypass</span>, as these options allow the machine to execute any script without
                    review. If a downloaded script is missing a trusted digital signature but nevertheless has been
                    deemed safe, then it can be exempted from the execution policy with the <span
                        class="snippet">Unblock-File</span> command. As suggested, the correct way to run local scripts
                    is to add a digital signature, which provides explicit authorization to execute the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the current execution policy:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Get-ExecutionPolicy</span></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To change the execution policy:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>AllSigned or RemoteSigned are generally recommended</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Set-ExecutionPolicy</span> AllSigned</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To create a digital signature:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">New-SelfSignedCertificate</span></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To locate the digital signature and save it to an environment variable:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>save all certificates to an environment variable</span></p>
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">dir</span> Cert:\CurrentUser -Recurse -CodeSigningCert
                        -OutVariable a</p>
                    <p class="comment"><span>save the first cert from list to separate variable</span></p>
                    <p class="command">$cert = $a[0]</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To add a digital signature to a script:
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="command"><span class="cmdlet">Set-AuthenticodeSignature</span> -Certificate $cert
                        -FilePath &lt;script-path&gt;</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    It is critical that administrators only sign scripts that they understand fully. When working in an
                    industrial setting, adding a digital signature is a way of assuming responsibility for the
                    consequences of script execution.

                    PowerShell is a powerful tool that can cause major system damage if mishandled. When unsure about
                    the ramifications of a certain command, administrators can use the <span
                        class="snippet">WhatIf</span> parameter to print out the results of the questionable command
                    without execution.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
                    <p class="comment"><span>the following command would kill all active services and likely damage the

                <p>
                    Administrators may also consider using the <span class="snippet">Confirm</span> parameter to be
                    prompted for confirmation before command execution.
                </p>
                <div class="console">
