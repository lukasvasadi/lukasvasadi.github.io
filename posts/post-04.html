                About a month ago, my mom and I decided to do a trip to celebrate my leaving for England. We had done something 
                similar, but on a much smaller scale, back before I started college. This time we decided on D.C. and Georgetown 
                because of our shared interest in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                We arrived in Georgetown to the Airbnb—a brownstone with bookcases covering every wall—located about four blocks 
                from the Potomac River. After getting settled, we set out to walk along the river and main streets. We passed all 
                kinds of shops, specialty stores selling men's suits, cafes, restaurants, etc., and walked over a dried canal to 
                reach the Potomac. Being so hot, we decided to buy water bottles from a local food stand. The people there didn't take 
                credit cards, but they did accept Venmo. "What the hell is Venmo?" cried my mom. I laughed along with the two guys 
                behind the stand, and then proceeded to explain that money can now be transferred through a phone app.
            </p>
            <p>
                We continued down the length of the river and eventually turned onto M Street, the main street where most shops and 
                cafes are located. The area was filled with college students. After about 20 minutes, we reached 1789, a rustic, 
                high-end restaurant erected from 18th-century townhouses. The dining room was filled with colonial era pictures and artifacts. 
                We were out of place with our casual dress and the food was served practically raw—a staple of high-class dining. We requested our 
                food be cooked longer, provoking contemptuous stares from the waiter. Well, I’d rather he hate me than eat raw beef.
            </p>
            <p>
                After dinner, we walked a few blocks over to Georgetown University and sat down on bench in front of the main cathedral-looking 
                building. We were just chatting and watching the students pass, the vibe reminiscent of my undergrad campus. After a few minutes, 
                we heard a Methodist preacher start giving a sermon to a crowd on the front lawn. Interspersed with the sermon were various songs 
                and prayers from a chorus.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the sun going down, we decided to start the journey home and grab some coffee along the way. Mom was getting tired and 
                suspicious of my directions. "Are you sure you know where we're going?" she asked after each intersection. "Mom,” I said, 
                “Do you trust me?”. “No.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We finally reached a coffeehouse near the Airbnb. Mom sat outside while I bought coffees and shortbread. We must’ve sat on that 
                bench for an hour, talking about topics of all sorts. At one point, a group of girls walked out of the bar next door. "Hey mom,” 
                I whispered, “Can you be my wingman?" "What does that mean?" she asked. "It means you help me get their attention." "How do I do 
                that? You don't stand much of a chance." We both started cracking up just as the girls walked past on the sidewalk. What strange people they must’ve thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Walking home, mom turned to me and said that this was one of the best nights that she’d had in a long time. “Then it was all worth it,” I said.
