            <h1>Interdisciplinary engineering</h1>
            <p>
                Before starting college, I attended a senior-level tissue engineering class at Stony Brook University
                and, at least for the next few years, wanted to design machines to grow human tissues for regenerative
                medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests deviated after joining a small biosensor startup in the UK, where I designed electrical
                and mechanical systems to support a novel electrical method for quantifying drug molecule binding
                efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                After our team raised investment capital, I returned to the US to join a tissue engineering startup,
                where my main focus has been building hardware and software for rapid imaging systems. Almost by
                accident, my early interests and later experiences came full-circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, I benefited from many opensource learning resources, ranging from Linux to PCB design to
                web development. This site is intended to contribute back to the engineering/hacker/tinkerer communities
                through tutorials and projects.
