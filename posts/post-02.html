            <h2>Hitchhiking Out West</h2>
            <h4>August 8, 2017</h4>
            <img src="../images/hitchhiking/hitchhiking-thumbnail.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                When the plans for a friend's bachelor party in Vegas were set, Bret had the idea to go early and 
                backpack through the Grand Canyon. But not only would we venture into the canyon, Bret suggested 
                that we travel predominantly by hitchhiking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agreed to the idea without much consideration. Of course, I knew that hitchhiking could be dangerous, 
                but figured two men would fare decent odds. Most of our family didn’t share this sentiment though—in fact, 
                I was almost surprised at the amount of pushback. On the way to the Newark airport, my dad—the man who once 
                rode his motorcycle from New Jersey to Oklahoma and slept in roadside ditches—told me I was an idiot. Besides 
                the obvious danger, he said that Bret and I could be targeted by the police. No matter, we were determined.
            </p>
            <p>
                After flying to Vegas and filling our backpacks with a variety of canned foods, cliff bars, and packaged brownies 
                from the supermarket, Bret and I started walking in the Nevada heat toward the highway. We entered from the ramp 
                and turned to face the oncoming traffic. With thumbs out and smiles on, we began the guiltless plea of soliciting 
                free rides. About 10 minutes later, a white van pulled over with "HIGHWAY SECURITY" written across its side. 
                I had a bad feeling, but this proved to be a minor setback as the patrolman was only concerned about our safety 
                and allowed us to continue heading toward the next exit.
            </p>
            <p>
                More time passed as we walked backwards with thumbs out. A Camaro sped by and I quietly pled that the driver would 
                stop for us. Bret heard and said, "Don't expect our first ride to be a 'Beamer, Benz, or Bentley.'" Another five 
                minutes passed and then a new Mercedes Benz pulled over and beeped at us. Our first ride. I’ll never forget Bret’s 
                face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first driving companion was a Russian immigrant from New York who was on his way to Bryce Canyon. He agreed to 
                drive us to a highway intersection about 1.5 hours away. He asked loads of questions about our trip—naturally, we 
                bonded over NY.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our next driver was a local Utah resident, Trevor, who was on his way to the post office. He drove us about 15 minutes, 
                and after a quick Wendy's detour for chocolate Frosties, Bret and I were back out on the highway, walking backwards with 
                thumbs out in the desert heat.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took about 10 minutes for our third driver, Grant, to pull off to the side of the road. Grant was a semi-pro mountain 
                biker, who travels the country to train and compete on various trails. He drove a large, beat-up maroon truck that housed 
                his biking gear. Having some familiarity with the area, Grant drove us up the mountain and dropped us off at a trailhead 
                bordering the highway. Bret broke out his drone and did some aerial photography of the nearby mountains.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next ride took a little time. Just when I started having doubts, a white pickup pulled off to the side. We were surprised 
                to see a lone woman, Michelle, as the driver. Michelle was a native Arizonan and drove us another 1.5 hours to an intersection 
                in a ghost town with one rundown motel and a dollar store. Bret and I stood at that intersection, snacking on beef jerky and 
                watching cars and tractor trailers pass, for a good while.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, a blue minivan pulled over and a couple stepped out to rearrange their trunk for our gear. They were a French couple 
                touring the US. The woman barely spoke English but asked us a few questions. We learned that she was a ski instructor in the French 
                Alps, while her husband worked as a research technician for the GE wind turbine division. Fortunately, since they were also heading 
                to the Grand Canyon, we were able to get a ride to the ranger information booth at the park entrance. At this time, the sun was 
                starting to set, and the temperature was dropping quickly. Bret and I said our goodbyes and continued walking on the road to the 
                Grand Canyon North Rim Lodge, where we planned to spend the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                One might expect the information booth to be located close to the canyon. No. Bret and I were walking for about 20 minutes when 
                we started to realize that we may have to camp out in the woods. (Later we learned that mountain lions were common in that area.) 
                Hope began to fade as the number of cars passing us grew scarce. I feebly held out my thumb.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as we were scoping out a nice area to set up camp, a minivan stopped on the shoulder. A woman, Debbie, offered us a ride. She 
                was leaving the Grand Canyon after a short visit with her daughter. She admitted that they almost didn't stop for us, but then thought 
                that her son would be the type stupid enough to hitchhike, and the mom instincts kicked in. We were relieved and grateful to not spend 
                the first night outside. Also, Debbie fed us cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                And just like that, six rides and 262 miles later, crossing three states (Nevada, Utah, and Arizona), we arrived at the Grand Canyon. 
                (We later got two more rides leaving the South Rim, raising the total distance to over 300 miles.) Bret and I asked each driver why 
                they decided to help us. Nearly all of them said that we looked (relatively) clean and honest. The large backpacks and signs helped too. 
                I figured this would be a one-time experience, but one year later we would be stuck in Germany without a ride to the train station and, 
                well, the thumbs went out...
